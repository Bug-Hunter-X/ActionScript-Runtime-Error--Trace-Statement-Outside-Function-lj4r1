function myFunction():void{
  trace("Hello, world!");
}

//This code will produce a runtime error when the program is executed.
//The reason is that the trace statement is outside the function myFunction. 
//As a result, it will not be executed. In order for the trace statement to be executed,
//it needs to be placed inside the function. The corrected code is as follows:

function myFunction():void{
 trace("Hello, world!");
}
myFunction();
